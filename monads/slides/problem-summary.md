<ul>
    <li class="fragment">Null-Pointer exceptions are no possible.</li>
    <li class="fragment">We have explicit control over what fields are optional.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="fragment">What is still missing?</h3>

<ul>
    <li class="fragment">We still have to manually check for empty values, when field is optional.</li>
</ul>
