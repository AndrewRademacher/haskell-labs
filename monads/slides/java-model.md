##  Java Example

Imagine for a moment you have the following data mode.

```java
public class Person {
    public String firstName;
    public String middleName;
    public String lastName;
    public Address homeAddress;
    public Address workAddress;
}
```

```java
public class Address {
    public String line1;
    public String line2;
    public String city;
    public String state;
    public int zipCode;
}
```
